My terminal actions are on record:

```bash
brew install sapling

# I had to do this command because of failure previous one
xcode-select --install

# And then again the previous command
brew install sapling

# Configure creds of your account
# You can just change your name/email if you wish :D
sl config --user ui.username "Roman Andreev <reykjavik151@gmail.com>"
